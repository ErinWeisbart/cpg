# Overview

The project aims to provide tools and libraries for bootstrapping, maintaining
and accessing the cellpainting gallery.

# Design goals

We aim to keep the codebase small and with as few dependencies as possible. This
is essential for adoption of the codebase as a dependency in other projects.
